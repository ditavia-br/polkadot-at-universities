# Course Materials Book

This book is the home of the majority of materials used within the Polkadot at Universities project and it is fork of [pba-book](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/pba-book).

## Read the Book

We suggest the [online](#hosted-online) version for general use, but cloning, installing, and building this book [offline](#build-offline) is a great option on-the-go.

### Hosted Online

The latest version is hosted <a target="_blank" href="http://143.42.125.19:1948/">here</a>

### Build Offline

The Core Developer Track of the Academy is Rust _heavy_ and as such, you need to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) before you can continue.

In order to `make` your life easy ðŸ˜‰, there is a set of tasks that use [`cargo make`](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/#overview).

With [`cargo make`](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/#installation) installed, you can list all tasks included to facilitate further installation, building, serving, formatting, and more with:

```sh
# Run from the top-level working dir of this repo
makers --list-all-steps
```

The tasks should be self-explanatory, if they are not - please file an issue to help us make them better.
