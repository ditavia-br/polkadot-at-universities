# Wasm Executor

In this activity, you will practice compiling Rust code to a few different wasm targets. You will also learn to embed a web assembly executor in your own binary application. We will focus on Rust, but also briefly look at executing wasm from Python to demonstrate the platform agnostic nature of Wasm.
